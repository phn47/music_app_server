[00:01.27]I miss the taste of a sweeter life
[00:04.65]I miss the conversation
[00:08.43]I'm searching for a song tonight
[00:12.23]I'm changing all of the stations
[00:16.50]I like to think that we had it all
[00:20.52]We drew a map to a better place

[00:24.70]But on that road I took a fall

[00:28.37]Oh baby why did you run away?



[00:31.48]I was there for you

[00:35.59]In your darkest times

[00:36.48]I was there for you

[00:37.68]In your darkest nights



[00:39.52]But I wonder where were you

[00:41.93]When I was at my worst

[00:43.68]Down on my knees

[00:45.80]And you said you had my back

[00:47.89]So I wonder where were you

[00:50.38]All the roads you took came back to me

[00:53.69]So I'm following the map that leads to you

[00:57.14]The map that leads to you

[00:59.15]Ain't nothing I can do

[01:01.38]The map that leads to you

[01:02.79]Following, following, following to you

[01:04.72]The map that leads to you

[01:06.93]And nothing I can do

[01:08.97]The map that leads to you

[01:10.80]Following, following, following



[01:12.87]I hear your voice in my sleep at night

[01:16.62]Hard to resist temptation

[01:19.98]Cause all these strangers come over me

[01:23.42]Now I can't get over you

[01:27.18]No, I just can't get over you



[01:31.71]I was there for you

[01:35.55]In your darkest times

[01:39.47]I was there for you

[01:39.90]In your darkest nights



[01:40.66]But I wonder where were you

[01:41.30]When I was at my worst

[01:44.10]Down on my knees

[01:46.25]And you said you had my back

[01:47.88]So I wonder where were you

[01:50.09]All the roads you took came back to me

[01:53.47]So I'm following the map that leads to you

[01:56.85]The map that leads to you

[01:59.08]Ain't nothing I can do

[02:01.19]The map that leads to you

[02:02.90]Following, following, following to you

[02:05.15]The map that leads to you

[02:07.76]And nothing I can do

[02:09.27]The map that leads to you

[02:11.40]oh oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah ah ah ah ah



[02:19.43]I was there for you

[02:22.03]In your darkest times

[02:23.87]I was there for you

[02:25.81]In your darkest nights



[02:27.93]I was there for you

[02:29.90]In your darkest times

[02:31.93]I was there for you

[02:33.84]In your darkest nights



[02:35.78]But I wonder where were you

[02:38.20]When I was at my worst

[02:41.51]Down on my knees

[02:43.51]And you said you had my back
