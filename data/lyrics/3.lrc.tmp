[00:12.28]But you lied, you lied to me
[00:13.73]Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

[00:16.62]I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me

[01:50.93]9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)

[01:53.98]Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)

[01:57.29]Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)

[02:00.48]You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)

[02:03.87]Your passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)

[02:07.45]You broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)

[02:10.96]Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)

[02:14.00]Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)

[02:17.15]I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)

[02:19.86]Said you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)

[02:49.12]But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me



[02:52.63]Settle down, I spell it out, it's simple enough

[02:56.04]I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut

[02:59.13]I don't play anymore, I went through your phone

[03:01.19]And caught the girls in your DMs and took all them home

[03:05.95]And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me

[03:09.51]Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me

[03:12.93]Turns out at shows 'cause they turn out at shows

[03:15.52]I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note

[03:18.83]Brought some strangers in our beds

[03:22.40]And now you lost your right to privacy

[03:26.08]Spilling all our secrets

[03:27.24]When you thought they'd probably die with me

[03:28.15]Know you fucking love it on the low

[03:29.17]And you don't have to say I'm crazy

[03:30.49]'Cause I know nothing's changed



[03:32.40]Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me

[03:34.24](You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)

[03:35.93]I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me

[03:38.25](But you lied, you lied, you lied)

[03:39.04]We were on the low, but you were getting high with me

[03:40.99](You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)

[03:42.33]When it's past 11, that's a different side I see

[03:44.20](But you lied, you lied, you lied)

[03:44.75]Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me

[03:46.97](You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)

[03:48.92]But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me

[03:52.16](But you lied, you lied, you lied)

[03:52.74]Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
