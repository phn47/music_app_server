[00:01.50]Copy the lyrics
[00:02.18]nobody pray for me
[00:05.56]even a day for me
[00:07.91]Waaaaay (yeah! yeah!)
[00:10.63]Ay, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
[00:13.86]Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits

[00:17.03]But now I'm countin' this

[00:17.92]Parmesan where my accountant lives

[00:19.65]In fact, I'm downin' this

[00:20.53]D'usse with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts

[00:23.41]Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub

[00:26.63]Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?

[00:30.04]I get way too petty once you let me do the extras

[00:33.07]Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris

[00:36.39]A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk

[00:39.30]Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk

[00:42.37]If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk

[00:45.79]If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

[00:49.00]My left stroke just went viral

[00:51.76]Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

[00:54.93]Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note

[00:58.07]It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble



[01:02.20](Hol' up, bitch) sit down

[01:04.25](Hol' up lil' bitch, hol' up lil' bitch) be humble

[01:08.77](Hol' up, bitch) sit down

[01:10.55](Sit down, hol' up, lil' bitch)

[01:11.96]Be humble (bitch)

[01:28.54]Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on man, man? (Man, man)

[01:30.00]Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)

[01:30.88]Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right

[01:36.25]I make a play fuckin' up your whole life

[01:39.52]I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop

[01:42.56]Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor

[01:46.25]Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretchmarks

[01:49.30]Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ayy

[01:52.73]This shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy

[01:54.31]I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy

[01:55.96]I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy

[01:57.57]I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy

[01:59.21]This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy

[02:00.82]Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy

[02:02.44]If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy

[02:04.26]I'm the realest nigga after all, bitch, be humble
