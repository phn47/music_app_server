[00:10.74]The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
[00:15.43]Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:18.96]Drinking fast and then we talk slow
[00:20.75]Come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:23.07]And trust me I'll give it a chance now
[00:26.36]Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox

[00:28.32]And then we start to dance and now I'm singing like



[00:30.65]Girl, you know I want your love

[00:33.04]Your love was handmade for somebody like me

[00:35.94]Come on now, follow my lead

[00:37.85]I may be crazy, don't mind me

[00:40.28]Say, boy, let's not talk too much

[00:42.89]Grab on my waist and put that body on me

[00:46.08]Come on now, follow my lead

[00:48.04]Come, come on now, follow my lead



[00:51.51]I'm in love with the shape of you

[00:54.26]We push and pull like a magnet do

[00:56.47]Although my heart is falling too

[00:59.17]I'm in love with your body

[01:01.68]And last night you were in my room

[01:04.32]And now my bedsheets smell like you

[01:06.21]Every day discovering something brand new

[01:09.45]I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

[01:13.74]I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

[01:18.60]I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

[01:23.80]I'm in love with your body

[01:26.21]Every day discovering something brand new

[01:28.97]I'm in love with the shape of you



[01:31.18]One week in we let the story begin, we're going out on our first date

[01:34.78]You and me are thrifty so go all you can eat

[01:37.82]Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

[01:40.61]We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

[01:43.58]And how your family is doing okay

[01:45.42]Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

[01:47.74]Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singing like



[01:50.27]Girl, you know I want your love

[01:52.92]Your love was handmade for somebody like me

[01:55.90]Come on now, follow my lead

[01:57.87]I may be crazy, don't mind me

[02:00.22]Say, boy, let's not talk too much

[02:02.86]Grab on my waist and put that body on me

[02:05.83]Come on now, follow my lead

[02:07.66]Come, come on now, follow my lead



[02:11.46]I'm in love with the shape of you

[02:14.16]We push and pull like a magnet do

[02:16.50]Although my heart is falling too

[02:18.71]I'm in love with your body

[02:21.40]And last night you were in my room

[02:23.86]And now my bedsheets smell like you

[02:26.19]Every day discovering something brand new

[02:28.75]I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

[02:30.80]I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

[02:34.21]I'm in love with your body (Ohiohiohiohi)

[02:44.48]I'm in love with your body

[02:46.25]Every day discovering something brand new

[02:49.05]I'm in love with the shape of you



[02:51.12]Come on, be my baby, come on

[02:53.11]Come on, be my baby, come on

[02:55.30]Come on, be my baby, come on

[02:58.24]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:00.83]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:03.19]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:05.59]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:08.08]Come on, be my baby, come on



[03:10.47]I'm in love with the shape of you

[03:13.53]We push and pull like a magnet do

[03:16.10]Although my heart is falling too

[03:18.83]I'm in love with your body

[03:21.54]Last night you were in my room

[03:23.97]And now my bedsheets smell like you

[03:26.54]Every day discovering something brand new

[03:29.03]I'm in love with your body



[03:31.31]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:33.43]Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

[03:36.03]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:38.75]Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

[03:41.09]Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:43.43]Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)

[03:45.67]Every day discovering something brand new

[03:48.61]I'm in love with the shape of you
