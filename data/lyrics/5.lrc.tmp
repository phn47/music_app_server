[00:01.58]Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks – (*record scratch*)
[00:05.02]Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
[00:07.83]'Round the outside, 'round the outside
[00:14.37]Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
[00:16.32]'Round the outside, 'round the outside



[00:22.08]Guess who's back, back again

[00:27.12]Shady's back, tell a friend

[00:31.33]Guess who's back, guess who's back

[00:32.77]Guess who's back, guess who's back



[00:48.35]I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to

[00:49.72]See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver

[00:52.68]Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya

[00:54.99]A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor

[00:57.22]Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker

[00:59.34]Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital

[01:01.56]By the doctor when I'm not co-operating

[01:03.28]When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)

[01:06.09]You waited this long, now stop debating

[01:07.73]‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

[01:10.19]I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney

[01:11.93]But your husband's heart problem's complicating

[01:14.18]So the FCC won't let me be

[01:15.84]Or let me be me, so let me see

[01:18.40]They try to shut me down on MTV

[01:20.54]But it feels so empty without me

[01:22.61]So, come on and dip, bum on your lips

[01:24.60]Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits

[01:26.78]And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy

[01:29.03]I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!



[01:31.33]Now this looks like a job for me

[01:33.32]So everybody, just follow me!

[01:35.48]‘Cause we need a little controversy

[01:37.58]‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[01:39.92]I said this looks like a job for me

[01:41.92]So everybody, just follow me!

[01:44.01]‘Cause we need a little controversy

[01:46.22]‘Cause it feels so empty without me



[01:48.37]Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious

[01:49.58]Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis

[01:50.69]They start feeling like prisoners helpless

[01:51.95]'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!!!"

[01:57.38]A visionary, vision is scary

[01:59.08]Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves

[02:01.91]A rebel, so just let me revel and bask

[02:03.48]In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​

[02:05.45]And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe

[02:07.30]For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?

[02:10.21]Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[02:12.22]Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna

[02:14.24]Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter

[02:16.08]The center of attention, back for the winter

[02:17.49]I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling

[02:19.20]Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting

[02:20.45]Testing, attention please

[02:24.02]Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me

[02:26.24]Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

[02:28.93]A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?



[02:31.19]Now this looks like a job for me

[02:33.06]So everybody, just follow me!

[02:35.18]‘Cause we need a little controversy

[02:37.16]‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[02:39.42]I said this looks like a job for me

[02:41.71]So everybody, just follow me!

[02:43.76]‘Cause we need a little controversy

[02:46.19]‘Cause it feels so empty without me



[02:48.15]A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with

[02:49.47]Anybody who's talking "this shit, that shit"

[02:50.61]Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked

[02:52.36]Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards

[02:53.81]And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie

[02:57.60]You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!

[03:01.33]You don't know me, you're too old, let go

[03:03.85]It's over, nobody listens to techno

[03:05.51]Now let's go, just give me the signal

[03:07.31]I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

[03:09.60]I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil

[03:11.71]Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

[03:14.19]But sometimes the shit just seems

[03:15.77]Everybody only wants to discuss me

[03:18.07]So this must mean I'm disgusting

[03:19.85]But it's just me, I'm just obscene

[03:22.53]No, I'm not the first king of controversy

[03:23.97]I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley

[03:25.45]To do black music so selfishly

[03:27.42]And use it to get myself wealthy

[03:32.63](Heyyy!) There's a concept that works

[03:33.62]Twenty million other white rappers emerge

[03:35.14]But no matter how many fish in the sea

[03:37.03]It'll be so empty without me



[03:39.72]Now this looks like a job for me

[03:41.73]So everybody, just follow me!

[03:43.51]‘Cause we need a little controversy

[03:45.82]‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[03:48.11]I said this looks like a job for me

[03:49.98]So everybody, just follow me!

[03:52.31]‘Cause we need a little controversy

[03:54.48]‘Cause it feels so empty without me



[03:56.18]Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la

[03:58.14]Hum dei dei la la Hum dei dei la la la la la

[04:13.30]Kids!
