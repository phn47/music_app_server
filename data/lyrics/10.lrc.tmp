[00:12.11]I won't lie to you
[00:17.00]I know he's just not right for you
[00:23.19]And you can tell me if I'm off
[00:24.82]But I see it on your face
[00:26.35]When you say that he's the one that you want
[00:29.03]And you're spending all your time

[00:32.28]In this wrong situation

[00:33.20]And anytime you want it to stop



[00:34.57]I know I can treat you better than he can

[00:39.83]And any girl like you deserves a gentleman

[00:45.92]Tell me why are we wasting time

[00:47.85]On all your wasted crying

[00:49.40]When you should be with me instead

[00:51.75]I know I can treat you better

[00:56.39]Better than he can



[00:59.18]I'll stop time for you

[01:03.39]The second you say you'd like me too

[01:09.53]I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing

[01:11.12]Baby just to wake up with you

[01:12.76]We'll be everything I need and this could be so different

[01:15.94]Tell me what you want to do



[01:19.28]'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can

[01:20.74]And any girl like you deserves a gentleman

[01:24.55]Tell me why are we wasting time

[01:32.27]On all your wasted crying

[01:36.04]When you should be with me instead

[01:38.20]I know I can treat you better

[01:42.76]Better than he can

[01:44.79]Better than he can



[01:56.43]Give me a sign, take my hand, we'll be fine

[02:01.82]Promise I won't let you down

[02:07.76]Just know that you don't have to do this alone

[02:13.02]Promise I'll never let you down



[02:18.71]'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can

[02:24.25]And any girl like you deserves a gentleman

[02:30.04]Tell me why are we wasting time

[02:33.91]On all your wasted crying

[02:34.87]When you should be with me instead

[02:36.17]I know I can treat you better



[02:40.70]Better than he can

[02:46.76]Better than he can

[02:52.64]Better than he can
