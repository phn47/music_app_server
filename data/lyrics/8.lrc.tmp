[00:12.27]You probably think that you are better now, better now
[00:15.33]You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
[00:18.59]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
[00:21.95]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
[00:25.22]You know I say that I am better now, better now
[00:28.51]I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

[00:31.90]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[00:35.25]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything



[00:40.25]I did not believe that it would end, no

[00:43.07]Everything came second to the Benz oh

[00:46.10]You're not even speaking to my friends, no

[00:49.44]You knew all my uncles and my aunts though

[00:52.82]Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes

[00:56.23]We were looking forward to the rest of our lives

[00:59.58]Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside

[01:02.86]Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like

[01:06.06]And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'

[01:09.05]With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas

[01:11.74]Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget

[01:13.81]But I can't get this shit outta my head



[01:18.63]You probably think that you are better now, better now

[01:21.62]You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

[01:24.94]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[01:28.20]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[01:31.48]You know I say that I am better now, better now

[01:34.92]I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

[01:38.29]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[01:41.61]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything



[01:46.11]I seen you with your other dude

[01:49.68]He seemed like he was pretty cool

[01:52.89]I was so broken over you

[01:56.28]Life it goes on, what can you do?

[01:59.22]I just wonder what itâ€™s gonna take

[02:02.46]Another foreign or a bigger chain

[02:05.45]Because no matter how my life has changed

[02:09.42]I keep on looking back on better days



[02:14.47]You probably think that you are better now, better now

[02:18.06]You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

[02:24.03]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[02:24.44]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[02:25.77]You know I say that I am better now, better now

[02:27.70]I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

[02:30.90]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[02:33.63]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[02:37.86]Oh-oh



[02:40.28]I promise

[02:41.26]I swear to you I'll be okay

[02:44.82]You're only the love of my life



[02:50.38]You probably think that you are better now, better now

[02:54.24]You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around

[02:57.77]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[03:01.03]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[03:04.15]You know I say that I am better now, better now

[03:07.43]I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

[03:10.80]You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

[03:14.24]Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

[03:15.99]Oh-oh
