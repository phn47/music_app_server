[00:07.83]I didn't think you'd understand me
[00:16.13]How could you ever even try?
[00:23.97]I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
[00:28.53]But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
[00:32.57]Just wanna let this story die
[00:38.55]And I'll be alright



[00:39.85]We can't be friends

[00:42.96]But I'd like to just pre-etend

[00:47.18]You cling to your papers and pens

[00:51.13]Wait until you like me again

[00:55.09]Wait for your love

[00:57.80]My love, I'll wait for your love



[01:05.69]Me and my truth, we sit in silence

[01:14.02]Mmm, baby girl, it's just me and you

[01:21.23]'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite

[01:26.20]My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die

[01:30.21]You got me misunderstood

[01:32.90]But at least I look this good



[01:37.73]We can't be friends

[01:40.81]But I'd like to just pre-etend

[01:44.88]You cling to your papers and pens

[01:48.71]Wait until you like me again

[01:53.14]Wait for your love

[01:57.31]My love, I'll wait for your love

[02:01.53]I'll wait for your love

[02:04.57]My love, I'll wait for your love



[02:10.27]Know that you made me

[02:13.77]I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging

[02:18.08]Not what you made me

[02:22.26]It's something like a daydream

[02:25.45]But I feel so seen in the night

[02:28.72]So for now, it's only me

[02:32.88]And maybe that's all I need



[02:36.38]We can't be friends

[02:38.74]But I'd like to just pre-etend

[02:42.70]You cling to your papers and pens

[02:46.96]Wait until you like me again

[02:51.16]Wait for your love

[02:55.36]My love, I'll wait for your love

[02:59.45]I'll wait for your love

[03:03.49]My love, I'll wait for your love



[03:07.76]I'll wait for your love

[03:11.36]I'll wait for your love

[03:15.59]I'll wait for your love

[03:17.49]I'll wait for your love

[03:20.02]I'll wait for your love
